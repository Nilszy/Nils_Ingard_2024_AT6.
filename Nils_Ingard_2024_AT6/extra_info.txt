Description:
UserInputValidator Class is designed to validate if a list 
consists of positive integers. 
First it is defined a method using the __init__method, 
including pass, leaving it open for future use.

Then there is defined a method called validate_positive_ingeters
who uses self and input_list as parameters. 
Self refering to the instance itself, input_list represents 
a variable for the user of the method to input his data. 

Valid_integers is a empty list, ready to recieve the returns 
of the method function. 
Then a for loop iterates thorugh the items in the input_list,
checking with an if statement, ifthe items are digits 
and positive integers.

if item is valid, the append function puts the item into the 
valid_integers list. 

Then the return statement returns the items now stored in the
valid_integers list, showing the potential valid integers found.
